# DataTable.js

A lightweight, fully customizable, pure JavaScript data table plugin designed to work with both static and dynamic data. Built with a forward-thinking, modular design, DataTable.js supports essential features like pagination, sorting, searching, export (CSV, PDF), and more. It's framework‑agnostic and works seamlessly in any project by including via CDN.
